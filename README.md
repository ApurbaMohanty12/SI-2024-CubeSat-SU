## Introduction to small satellites and formal CubeSats 🧊
<ul>
  <li>CubeSat is an actual spacecraft i.e launched into orbits,which is basically developed in educational institutes.</li>
  <li>It began as a collaborative effort in 1999 between Jordi Puig-Suari(a professor at Cal Poly) and Bob Twiggs(a professor at SSDL).</li>
  <li>The original intent of the project was to provide access to space for Space Uni Science Community.Many major schools and universities have also been able to start CCubeSats program of their own.</li>
  <li>Govt. agencies and commercial groups around the world have developed CubeSats.</li>
  <li>It can help reduce the costs of techical development and scientific investigations,and increase accrss to space,an exponential growth in the popularity of CubeSats.</li>
  
</ul>

## CubeSats 🧊
<ul>
  <li>CubeSats makes it possible for companies to mass produce components and shelf parts.</li>
  <li>It also helps reduce costs associated with transporting them and deploying them into space.</li>
  <li>They come in several sizes(based on one unit or 1U)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1U=10cm cube</li>
    <li>Mass=1.33kg</li>
  </ul>
  <li>We can have sizes upto 1.5U,2U,3U,6U & 12U.</li>
  
</ul>

## CubeSat Dispenser Systems 🚀
<ul>
  <li>It is the interface between CubeSat and Launch Vehicle</li>
  <li>It provides attachment to launch vehicles,and also protects the CubeSat during launch and releases it into space,and also protects the CubeSat during launch and releases it into space at appropriate time.</li>
  <li>All of these are designed to hold satellites that conform to standard CubeSat form factor.</li>
  <li>3 U Dispensers</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The first dispenser of CubeSat ws Poly Pico satellite Orbital Deployes(P-POD),developed by Cal Poly,San Luis Obipso.It can hold upto 3Us of CubeSat payloads or any combination that adds upto 3U.</li>
    <li>When its time to release the payload,then the launch vehicle sends an electrical signal to P-POD that causes the door to open and release CubeSats</li>
    <li>Although most dispensers have have different designs,they all tend to follow the same basic idea.In the beginning ,P-POD may have been the only option for CubeSats,but now there are several dispenser choices.</li>
    
  </ul>
  <li>6 U Dispensers</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In 2014,6U was born.The form factor of 6U is essentially the same as two 3Us side by side,making it twice as wide.</li>
    <li>They function similarly to the 3U Dispensers.</li>
  </ul>
  
  
</ul>

 ## Launch Vehicle 🚀
 <ul>
   <li>CLSI contracts with multiple launch services that allow CubeSats to hitch a ride.</li>
   <li>When the CubeSat or dispenser package was first dreamed up,the idea was to bolt the the dispenser onto the rocket where space was available.</li>
   <li>A CubeSat can be sent with the cargo on a resupply mission to the SpaceStation.The CubeSat would be taken abroad the SpaceStation and released into space in specially designed deployer.</li>
 </ul>

 ## Development Process Overview 📊
 <ul>
   <li>The overall timeframe can vary depending on the launch vehicles selected and what you are trying to accomplish with your CubeSat.</li>
   <li>A CubeSat can be designed,bulit,tested and delivered in as little as 9 months,but it takes typically,18 to 24 months to complete.
   Once your CubeSat is delivered,the typical time to launch is anywhere from few months to few years.This is obviously affected by the availability of launch oppurtunities,but also by the feasibilty of your orbital requirements-the more flexible,the easier to manifest,and therefore the shorter wait. </li>
   <li>Launch vehicles will usually require you to deliver your finished CubeSat between 4 to 6 months,prior to launch.</li>

# Basics of Satellite Communication 🔊
## Introduction to Communication and Signal Processing 🔊

  ## Modulated Techniques For Mobile Radio 📲
  <ul>
<li>	Modulation is the process of encoding information from a message source in a manner suitable for transmission.</li>
<li>	It generally involves translating a base band signal (called a source) to a band pass signal at frequencies that are very high when compared to the base-band frequencies.</li>
<li>The band pass signal is called the modulated signal and the base band signal is called the modulating signal.</li>
<li>	Modulation may be done by varying amplitude, phase or frequency of a high frequency carrier in accordance with the amplitude of the message signal.</li>
<li>	Demodulation is the process of extracting the baseband message from the carrier so that it may be processed and interpreted by the intended receiver (the sink).</li>


</ul>

  ## Digital Modulation 📲
  <ul>
    <li>It is the process of encoding a digital information signal into the amplitude, phase, or frequency of the transmitted signal.</li>
    <li>Digital Modulation provides more information capacity, high data security, quicker system availability with great quality communication. Hence, digital modulation techniques have a greater demand, for their capacity to convey larger amounts of data than analog modulation techniques.</li>
<li>	Modern mobile communication systems use digital modulation techniques. Advancements in VLSI and DSP technology have made digital modulation more cost effective than analog transmissions systems.</li>
<li>This offers many advantages over analog transmissions like greater noise immunity, robustness to channel impairments, easdier multiplexing of various forms of information(like voice, data, video, etc) and greater security.</li>
<li>It accommodated digital error control codes which detect and /or correct transmission errors, and support complex signal conditioning and processing techniques such as source coding , encryption and equalization to improve the performance of the overall communication link.</li>
<li>	Here, the modulating signal maybe represented as a time sequence of symbols or pulses, where each symbol have m infinite states. Each symbol represents n bits where 
n=log2m bits/symbol.</li>
<li>There are many types of digital modulation techniques</li>
<ul>
  <li>ASK-Amplitude Shift Key </li>
  <li>FSK-Frequency Shift Key</li>
  <li>PSK-Phase Shift Key</li>
</ul>
    
  </ul>

## Demodulation 📲
<ul>
  <li>Demodulation is defined as extracting the original information-carrying signal from a modulated carrier wave.</li>
  <li>A demodulator is an electronic circuit that is mainly used to recover the information content from the modulated carrier wave.</li>
  <li>It is done by using a diode to rectify the signals and extract the audio content, or else via filtering to separate the high-frequency carrier signal from the audio content.</li>
  
</ul>




## FFT
<ul>
  <li>Stands for Fast Fourier Transformation</li>
  <li>It is an important measurement method in the science of audio and acoustics measurement. It converts a signal into individual spectral components and thereby provides frequency information about the signal. </li>
  <li>In the Fourier transformation, the assumption is that the sampled signal segment is repeated periodically for an infinite period of time. This brings two conclusions:
<ul>
<li>The FFT is only suitable for periodic signals.</li>
<li>The sampled signal segment must contain a whole number of periods.</li>
  <li>. The sampling of a signal whose frequencies are not an integer multiple of df would begin and end within a block of 2^n samples with different values. This results in a jump in the time signal, and a "smeared" FFT spectrum.</li>
  
</ul>
</ul>

![FFT-Smearing-540](https://github.com/ApurbaMohanty12/SI-2024-CubeSat-SU/assets/173773194/a9aaba65-7e24-4eba-a940-6894185e113e)

## SpreadSpectrum 📑
<ul>
  <li>  These are techniques by which a signal generated with a particular bandwidth is deliberately spread in the frequency domain over a wider frequency band.</li>
  <li> It is one in which the transmitted signal is spread over a wide frequency band, much wider than the bandwidth required to transmit the message.</li>
  <li>Such a system would take a baseband voice signal with a bandwidth of a few kilohertz and spread it to a band of many megahertz.</li>
  <li>It protects the message signal from interference, environmental noise,8cm jamming. It also ensures secure communication and reduces the probability of signal detection.</li>

  ### Shannon Hartley Theorem
  <ul>
    <li>The Shannon capacity theorem defines the maximum amount of information, or data capacity, which can be sent over any channel or medium (wireless, coax, twister pair, fiber etc.). What this says is that higher the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio and more the channel bandwidth, the higher the possible data rate.</li>

### RSSI and SNR
<ul>
  <li>RSSI stands for Received Signal Strength Indicator,which tells us how well your device can receive signal.</li>
  <li>The higher the RSSI value, the stronger the signal.</li>
  <li>SNR stands for Sound to Noise Ratio and it is ratio of signal power to the noise power.</li>
  <li>Unit of expression - decibles (dB)</li>
  <li>The higher the ratio, the better the signal quality.</li>

## Tunning of Antenna using VNA 📡
<ul>
  <li> Tunning of antenna ensures that the impedances of the feedline and the antenna match perfectly, so that all available power is being radiated.</li>
  <li>Actual 'tuning' of an antenna involves adjusting its length, or attaching wire and tubing appendages to the structure that add either capacitance or inductance to the path of currents through the antenna.</li>

  ### Install and Setup 💻
  <ul>
    <li>Connect your ESP32-LoRa board to your desktop/laptop.</li>
    <li>Follow the instructions on the web installer to install the latest tinyGS firmware.
Config detailed in this GitPage
Noticed that for flashing the board, needed to hold the BOOT button down while connecting the USB cable but not sure. Also mentioned in VU3ZAG's blog.</li>
    <li>After successful flash, boot it up and it will become a hotspot with SSID My Tiny GS.</li>
    <li>Connect to the hotspot and browse to 192.168.4.1 and configure the board.</li>
    <li>MQTT and WiFi login credentials will be provided to you.</li>
    <li>For the Board Type select 433 MHz TTGO LoRa 32 v2 from the dropdown menu.</li>
    <li>Select TX to make sure that the test mode can be used.</li>
    <li>Once all info is entered click on the Apply button. The ESP32 will reboot and if all went well the ground station should appear on the Tiny GS site.</li>
    <li>Once the ground station is estabilished, you can get a temporary passwordless link to your station by typing /weblogin in your telegram BOT. This link will allow you to modify the groundsation parameters.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>After this setup the antenna and receive the packets </li>
