Introduction to small satellites and formal CubeSats
1.1 Introduction
-CubeSat is an actual spacecraft that is,launched into orbits.
-It began as a collaborative effort in 1999 between Jordi Puig-Suari(a professor at Cal Poly) and Bob Twiggs (a professor at SSDL).
-The original intent of the project was to provide access to space for Space Uni Science Community.
-Many major universities have a space program,infact smaller universities ,high schools,have also been able to start CubeSats program of their own.
-Government agencies and commercial groups around the world have developed CubeSats.
-It can help reduce costs of technical development and scientific investigations.
-It has increased access to space,an exponential growth in the popularity of CubeSats.
*CLSI-stands for CubeSat Launch Initiative.
    -It is a NASA initiative that provides oppurtunities for qualified CubeSats to fly as auxiliary payloads(the tewchnological instrument carried on board a satellite for the specific purpose) on future launches that have excess capacities.
    -It enables NASA to develop public private partnerships that provide a low cost platform for NASA science missions,including planetary explorations,Earth observation and find Earth Science.



1.2 CubeSats
-A small satellite is generally cosidered to be any satellite that weighs less than 300kg.
-It makes it possible for companies to mass produce components and offer off shelf parts.It also
